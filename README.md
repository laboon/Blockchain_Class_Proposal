# Blockchain_Class_Proposal
Proposal for blockchain technology course

## Goal

This course provides students with an understanding of blockchain technology.  It will cover basic concepts such as data structures and the cryptography behind the blockchain, as well as a history of its development.  It will do so by exploring Bitcoin and related cryptocurrency implementations, along with implementing distributed applications.

## Prerequisites
CS1501 Algorithm Implementation

## Syllabus

### Week 1

What is a blockchain?
How does it work? (high-level)
Benefits / Drawbacks
Pre-History and History of Blockchain

### Week 2
 
Hashing (how to choose a good hashing algo)
Public-key Cryptography
Elliptic curve cryptography

### Week 3-4:

How does Bitcoin work? (details)
Addresses
UTXOs
Mining (securing the blockchain)
Nonces
Merkle trees
Attacks and security (sybil attack, 51% attack, etc)

### Week 5

Altcoins and variations 
  * Primecoin (useful POW)
  * Litecoin (Scrypt PoW)
  * IOTA  (DAG)
  * Monero (CryptoNight and anonymity)
  * Nxt (proof-of-stake instead of proof-of-work)
  * Vertcoin (ASIC-resistant POW)

### Week 6

The road ahead for cryptocurrencies
SegWit (segregated witness)
Lightning networks
Atomic swaps and other cross-chain collaboration

### Week 7
Intro to Ethereum
  * A "Turing-complete version of Bitcoin"
  * Understanding smart contracts
  * ICOs
  * DAOs
  * The GHOST (Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree) protocol
  * Patricia trees (compared to Merkle trees)

### Week 8-9
  * What is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)?
  * Learning Solidity (most popular language that compiles to EVM bytecode)

### Week 10-11-12
  * Developing our own token on Ethereum
  * Developing our own DAO (distributed autonomous organization
  * Developing a dapp (distributed app) for the final project
