# Blockchain_Class_Proposal
Proposal for blockchain technology course

## Goal

This course provides students with an understanding of blockchain technology.  It will cover basic concepts such as data structures and the cryptography behind the blockchain, as well as a history of its development.  It will do so by exploring Bitcoin and related cryptocurrency implementations, along with implementing distributed applications.

## Prerequisites
CS1501 Algorithm Implementation

## Syllabus

### Week 1

1. What is a blockchain?
1. How does it work? (high-level)
1. Benefits / Drawbacks
1. Pre-History and History of Blockchain

### Week 2
 
1. Hashing (how to choose a good hashing algo)
1. Public-key Cryptography
1. Elliptic curve cryptography

### Week 3-4:

1. How does Bitcoin work? (details)
1. Addresses
1. UTXOs
1. Mining (securing the blockchain)
1. Nonces
1. Merkle trees
1. Attacks and security (sybil attack, 51% attack, etc)

### Week 5

Altcoins and variations 
  * Primecoin (useful POW)
  * Litecoin (Scrypt PoW)
  * IOTA  (DAG)
  * Monero (CryptoNight and anonymity)
  * Nxt (proof-of-stake instead of proof-of-work)
  * Vertcoin (ASIC-resistant POW)

### Week 6

The road ahead for cryptocurrencies
  * SegWit (segregated witness)
  * Lightning networks
  * Atomic swaps and other cross-chain interaction
  
### Week 7

Intro to Ethereum
  * A "Turing-complete version of Bitcoin"
  * Understanding smart contracts
  * ICOs
  * DAOs
  * The GHOST (Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree) protocol
  * Patricia trees (compared to Merkle trees)

### Week 8-9

1. What is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)?
1. Learning Solidity (most popular language that compiles to EVM bytecode)

### Week 10-11-12

1. Developing our own token on Ethereum
1. Developing our own DAO (distributed autonomous organization
1. Developing a dapp (distributed app) for the final project
